Modern software development heavily relies on continuous testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of applications. Testing strategies range from unit testing and integration testing to system testing and user acceptance testing. Automated testing, implemented through frameworks such as Selenium and JUnit, enhances efficiency by executing test scripts without human intervention.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines streamline the development process by incorporating automated testing at various stages. Regression testing helps detect unintended side effects of code modifications, while performance testing assesses an applicationâ€™s behavior under different loads. Security testing, on the other hand, identifies vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

By integrating robust testing methodologies, software teams can enhance product quality and user satisfaction, ensuring seamless deployment in real-world environments.
